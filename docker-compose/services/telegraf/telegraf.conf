# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})

  ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of
  ## tags.
  ## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
  ## available properties for a device by running:
  ## 'udevadm info -q property -n /dev/sda'
  ## Note: Most, but not all, udev properties can be accessed this way. Properties
  ## that are currently inaccessible include DEVTYPE, DEVNAME, and DEVPATH.
  # device_tags = ["ID_FS_TYPE", "ID_FS_USAGE"]
  #
  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.
  ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
  ## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
  ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
  ## the near-meaningless DM-0 name.
